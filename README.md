# House_Prices-Explained-step-by-step-

Project Overview:
In this project, our goal is to make predictions about future house prices. To achieve this, we will utilize data from the Federal Reserve and house price data from Zillow. Our approach involves combining and merging these datasets. We will then proceed to train a random forest model. This model will help us determine whether house prices are likely to increase or decrease in the future. We will evaluate its performance using backtesting, and if necessary, enhance the model by introducing new predictive factors.



Project Steps

Data Loading
Data Cleaning and Integration 
Initial Machine Learning Model 
Model Accuracy Improvement 
Diagnostics and Improvement

By following these steps, we aim to create an effective model for predicting future house prices, with an ongoing focus on refining and enhancing its performance.
