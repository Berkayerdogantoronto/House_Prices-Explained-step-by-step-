## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for future house prices by leveraging data from the Federal Reserve and house price data from Zillow. The primary challenge is to accurately forecast whether house prices are likely to increase or decrease in the future. This predictive model is essential for homeowners, real estate professionals, and investors who need reliable insights into the housing market.

## Business Impacts
* The successful development of a predictive model for future house prices can align with the organization's long-term strategic objectives, enhancing its capabilities in the real estate market.
* Homeowners, real estate professionals, and investors will benefit from reliable insights into the housing market. They can make informed decisions about buying, selling, or investing in properties.
* Real estate professionals and investors can use the predictive model to assess market trends and make proactive decisions to mitigate potential financial risks.
* Homeowners can use market insights to make informed decisions about property investments, improving their overall customer experience in real estate transactions.
  
## Project Steps
* Data Loading - Gather and integrate data from multiple sources, including the Federal Reserve and Zillow, to create a comprehensive dataset that encompasses relevant features and historical house price trends.
* Data Cleaning and Integration - Prepare and clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, merging datasets where necessary to create a unified and reliable source of information.
* Initial Machine Learning Model - Train an initial random forest machine learning model to predict future house price movements. This model serves as the foundation for forecasting.
* Model Accuracy Improvement - Continuously refine the model to enhance its predictive accuracy. This includes optimizing model parameters and feature selection to achieve reliable results.
* Diagnostics and Improvement - Evaluate the model's performance using backtesting and other diagnostic methods. If necessary, introduce new predictive factors or features to improve the model's ability to forecast house price trends accurately.
